the <a href=https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/65d4c337-66fd-4d22-8a21-e836fafbebc4>&ldquo;Linux Kernel Bug Fixing&rdquo;</a> mentorship from the Linux Foundation.
Writing about the experience is one of the required tasks and that is indeed the
motivation behind the creation of this blog, although I flirted with the idea before but
never got to actually publish anything. Since the main task of the mentorship is to fix
bugs, I&rsquo;m gonna try to organize my thoughts about the workflow for accomplishing that in
this post. The basic assumption is of course x86_64, for the sake of simplicity.</p><p>The Linux Kernel is a vast project that spans many areas of computing and long are the
days where a single mind could understand it all as a whole. The majority of the work in
it is done by big companies that need to support it for their operation. It can be
overwhelming to even try finding a <a href=https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/development-process.html>place where to start</a> and this is why
intern and mentorship programs are so important! It is typical for first time
contributors to any FOSS project to focus on QA - Quality Assurance. That could mean
many things but in the context of the Linux Kernel, fixing bugs is the best example. In
other projects, simply using it extensively and reporting a bug found is already a great
contribution, but for simple desktop users such as myself it is rather difficult to come
across a bug in the kernel, these days.</p><p>This is where automated tools such as <a href=https://github.com/google/syzkaller/>Syzkaller</a> can come in handy. It is a
fuzzer and nowadays it supports all other major kernels. Software fuzzing is a technique
that feeds random inputs into a program until it crashes and it can be done with pretty
much any program that takes input somehow. In the context of the Linux Kernel, that can
get quite complicated, but it is not the scope of this text to go much into these
details. Please refer to <a href=https://www.linuxfoundation.org/webinars/dynamic-program-analysis-for-fun-and-profit>this excellent presentation</a> by one of the original
developer of the tool, Dmitry Vyukov. For the purpose of this text it is sufficient to
say that there is <a href=https://syzkaller.appspot.com/>infrastructure</a> setup that extensively test the kernel in
many <a href=https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream/repos>trees</a> and architectures, so that bugs get reported to the mailing
lists as they&rsquo;re found.</p><p>There are many other tools available for testing and finding bugs in the kernel, of
which Sergio Prado wrote a <a href=https://sergioprado.blog/how-is-the-linux-kernel-tested/>nice summary</a> about. But the goal here is to focus
on the <strong>fixing</strong> part of the process. For that I must refer the reader to <a href=https://lwn.net/images/pdf/LDD3/ch04.pdf>Chapter
4</a> of the classic book &ldquo;Linux Device Drivers&rdquo;. It is also a good idea to read the
available documentation of the kernel on the subject, such as <a href=https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kgdb.html>this</a>.
Another technique which is essential to the task is tracing, which was masterfully
introduced in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRyrhsx-L5Y">this talk</a> by Steven Rostedt.</p><p>Another <a href=https://www.linuxfoundation.org/webinars/tools-and-techniques-to-debug-an-embedded-linux-system>great introduction</a> on debugging tools and techniques was made by
Sergio Prado. In it, he starts by splitting the most common problems in 5 categories,
namely:</p><ul><li>Crash</li><li>Lockup / Hang</li><li>Logic / Implementation</li><li>Resource Leakage</li><li>Performance</li></ul><p>Each one of these require a different set of skills and strategies, which include log
and dump analysis, tracing and profiling, interactive debugging, etc. The basic workflow
to fix a bug is comprised of a few high level steps:</p><ul><li>Find the bug</li><li>Reproduce it</li><li>Identify the cause</li><li>Develop the fix</li><li>Test that it worked</li></ul><p>For each of these steps there are several sub-steps, depending on the degree of
complexity of the problem. For simplicity, let&rsquo;s illustrate what a common crash analysis
reported by Syzkaller would look like. First, go to its dashboard and find a bug you
might be interested on. Make sure to read <a href=https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/linux/>their documentation</a> before that.
You gonna need to know the basics of a kernel <strong>oops</strong>, too. Refer to <a href=https://www.opensourceforu.com/2011/01/understanding-a-kernel-oops/>here</a> as a
good starting point.</p><p>After finding the bug, you must be able to reproduce it. Many of the bugs reported have
C programs carefully crafted by the tool that will trigger the issue. There are also a
special <strong>syz</strong> program, but we&rsquo;ll get into that later. For each bug, the syzbot also
supply us with the kernel <strong>.config</strong> file and the specific commit which triggers the
issue. That is, if you run the C reproducer on any other kernel version, or any other
configuration, the problem may not arise. So, if you want to be able to successfully
reproduce it, you must take that into account. The bot also provides a bootable
QEMU-enabled disk image and the kernel <strong>vmlinux</strong> and <strong>bzImage</strong> for your convenience
(more on that <a href=https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/syzbot_assets.md>here</a>). That is excellent for rapid testing, however if you
are to locally test a patch you&rsquo;re developing, you gonna need to build it anyway.</p><p>Alright, so the goal is to reproduce the error in a QEMU virtual machine with a locally
built <strong>bzImage</strong>. But first things first. A kernel image by itself isn&rsquo;t of much use
without a root filesystem from where you can run a reproducer program. I recommend at
least once going through the process of <a href=https://ibug.io/blog/2019/04/os-lab-1/>manually creating</a> an initramfs to boot
into, after reading about it in the <a href=https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.html>kernel documentation</a>. Luckily, there
are many tools to accomplish that automatically, such as <a href=https://buildroot.org/>Buildroot</a> - which
is extra useful if you&rsquo;re hacking around with embedded devices and cross-compilation.
But since the context here is Syzkaller, let&rsquo;s use <a href=https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/tools/create-image.sh>their script</a>, so download
it somewhere into your system. It is an automated tool to create a suitable image to use
with QEMU. It leverages Debian&rsquo;s <a href=https://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap>Debootstrap</a> tool, so if you&rsquo;re not
running Debian this is another reason to :)</p><p>Create a trixie (current Debian&rsquo;s <a href=https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases><strong>testing</strong> distribution</a>) image like
so (make sure you have the required dependencies installed):</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#3c3836;background-color:#fbf1c7;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>wget <span style=color:#79740e>&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/syzkaller/master/tools/create-image.sh&#34;</span>

also used the same <strong>.config</strong> file to build the <strong>bzImage</strong>. Note that the assumption
here is that your host is running Debian as well, which is the same system as the bot.
In some builds it uses clang so the appropriated <strong>CC=clang</strong> flag should be used. Also,
you could add a few debugging configurations to the kernel, since we&rsquo;ll be using that

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This QEMU command will spawn a x86_64 virtual machine (of type pc-q35-7.1,
<strong>qemu-system-x86_64 -machine help</strong> for more options) and boot your kernel into the
trixie rootfs, make sure to point to the correct paths in the <strong>$ROOTFS</strong> and
<strong>$BZIMAGE</strong> variables. This command is given as a reference in the Syzkaller&rsquo;s
<a href=https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/syzbot.md#crash-does-not-reproduce>documentation</a>, however you should take a look at QEMU&rsquo;s <a href=https://qemu-project.gitlab.io/qemu/index.html>manual
pages</a> if you haven&rsquo;t yet. You can see we passed both the kernel image and the
rootfs disk as parameters, and since the <strong>create-image.sh</strong> script also take care of
setting up networking and a SSH server for us (that&rsquo;s why it also yields
<strong>trixie.id_rsa</strong> and <strong>trixie.id_rsa.pub</strong>), the command will spawn a network interface
with your local host 10022 port being forwarded into its 22 port through the <strong>-net</strong>
argument. That means you can log into the guest system and transfer files through the
ssh protocol using <strong>localhost:10022</strong>.</p><p>Another important parameter is <strong>-snapshot</strong>. Using it means that whatever modification
you do to the rootfs won&rsquo;t be persisted through reboots. So if you transfer a file into
it and halt the system, it won&rsquo;t be there when you start a machine again with it. That
makes possible for many guests running in parallel using the same rootfs. You could also
remove this argument for one time in order to make changes such as changing the root
password or installing a dependency. For example, if you want to reproduce bugs using
the <strong>syz</strong> program reproducer you are gonna need to build syzkaller locally and transfer
the <strong>bin/linux_amd64/syz-executor</strong> and <strong>bin/linux_amd64/syz-execprog</strong> files into the
rootfs, so you can transfer these files just once, without having to redo this step
every time you boot a kernel.</p><p>So now that the machine is running, you can go ahead and reproduce the bug in it. First,
download the reproducer program, then transfer it into the rootfs and finally log into
it through ssh (note that you could do this from inside the rootfs, by ssh&rsquo;ing first):</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#3c3836;background-color:#fbf1c7;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>wget <span style=color:#79740e>&#34;https://syzkaller.appspot.com/x/repro.c?x=14eb56dba80000&#34;</span> -O reproducer.c

you can use the <strong>-s</strong> argument to the QEMU command. That&rsquo;s when a <strong>vmlinux</strong> image
with debugging information is useful. Could be the one you downloaded from the syzbot
bug report or the one you built before (if you enabled KGDB as suggested, you&rsquo;re gonna
be better equipped than using the image that syzbot provided). Start the virtual machine
like before , appending the <strong>-s</strong> argument. Then, start <strong>gdb</strong> passing the <strong>vmlinux</strong>
as argument:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#3c3836;background-color:#fbf1c7;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>VMLINUX<span style=color:#af3a03>=</span><span style=color:#79740e>&#34;</span>$HOME<span style=color:#79740e>/linux/vmlinux&#34;</span>

the one mentioned in this post, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I set a breakpoint at the

sure to see if the problem wasn&rsquo;t already fixed by someone else before sending the patch
upstream, though. Anyway, we didn&rsquo;t even scratch the surface here, but I hope this sheds
light into basic debugging techniques and make you better equipped to explore your way
into the kernel internals!</p></div></main><footer>&copy; <a href=https://github.com/rbmarliere/marliere.net>Copyleft</a>
