My name is Ricardo, I'm a software engineer born in Brazil in July of the year 1991.
When I'm not at my desk studying about computers and technology or occasionally gaming,
I like to [play guitar][pathos] and write songs. I have a small vinyl
[collection][discogs] and own a few vintage out of print esoteric books. On some
weekends, if I'm lucky, I'll be crossing the finish line in a racing car at a track
somewhere. But more commonly I'll be offline enjoying the company of my beautiful wife
and the amazing things she cook. I'm also a private pilot currently pursuing my IFR
license.
