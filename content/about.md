Hi, my name is Ricardo and I'm from Brazil. I love computers since my early teens and
I'm currently working for [SUSE]. When I’m not at my desk studying technology or
occasionally gaming, I like to [play guitar][pathos] and write songs. I have a small
[vinyl collection][discogs] and own a few old out of print books. On some weekends, if
I’m lucky, I’ll be crossing the finish line in a racing car at a track somewhere. But
more commonly I’m enjoying the company of my beautiful wife and the amazing things she
cook. I’m also a private pilot and aviation geek.
