Hi, my name is Ricardo and I'm from Brazil. I love computers since my early teens and I
have mostly worked with web development professionally but always with a strong
curiosity and passion for operating systems and open source software. When I’m not at my
desk studying technology or occasionally gaming, I like to [play guitar][pathos] and
write songs. I have a small [vinyl collection][discogs] and own a few old out of print
books. On some weekends, if I’m lucky, I’ll be crossing the finish line in a racing car
at a track somewhere. But more commonly I’m enjoying the company of my beautiful wife
and the amazing things she cook. I’m also a private pilot and aviation geek.
