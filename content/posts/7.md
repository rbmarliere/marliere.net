title: "Effective use of git-worktree"

I've mentioned before this hidden gem that is the [git-worktree] feature. It enables one
to work with many branches checked out at the same time, giving ease of mind whenever
you need to switch context. However, it comes with its own set of caveats.

## Problems

1. When cloning a bare repository, the default branch is not defined since there are no
	 initial working tree configured.

1. In a bare repository, there are no initial remote to local mapping of heads [^1].
	 That means you must set them manually for each branch, e.g.

	```shell
	git config remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"
	```

1. Since you most probably will be having multiple remotes, you must also set
	 branch.NAME.pushRemote manually (see [Upstream Tracking]({{< relref "#upstream-tracking" >}})).

1. Dealing with submodules is not quite straight forward (see [Moving a Worktree]({{< relref "#moving-a-worktree" >}})).

For 1 and 2 one can get around by using these aliases in their **~/.config/git/config**,
which can be especially useful for existing repositories or newly created worktrees:

```txt
[alias]
set-pushRemote = "!git config --unset-all branch.$(git branch --show-current).pushRemote 2>/dev/null; git config branch.$(git branch --show-current).pushRemote $1"
set-origin = "!f() { local re=${1:-origin}; git config remote.$re.fetch \"+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/$re/*\"; git fetch $re; git branch -u $re/$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD); }; f"
```

This way, you can at any time (i.e. branch|tree) set the merge remote and the push
remote, e.g.:

```shell
git set-origin origin
git set-pushRemote rbmarliere
```

## Clone Script

To quickly set up default branch worktree after `git-clone`, one might find this script
useful:

```bash
set -euo pipefail

if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
    echo "usage: clone <url> [target dir] [remote name]"
    exit
fi

URL=${1:?no url specified}
TARGET=${2:-$(basename -s .git "$URL")}
REMOTE=${3:-origin}  # or extract from URL: $(echo "$URL" | awk -F'[:/]' '{print $(NF-1)}')

if ! git clone --bare "$URL" -o "$REMOTE" "$TARGET"; then
    echo "error cloning $URL"
    exit 1
fi

pushd "$TARGET"
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
if ! git worktree add "$DEFAULT_BRANCH"; then
    echo "error creating worktree $DEFAULT_BRANCH"
    exit 1
fi

pushd "$DEFAULT_BRANCH"
git submodule update --init --recursive
git set-origin "$REMOTE"  # needs to be defined in ~/.config/git/config

popd
popd
```

## Upstream Tracking

When creating a branch, you might want to track a remote branch:
```shell
git branch newbranch --track remotefoo/newbranch
```
That will create the following configuration:

```txt
[branch "newbranch"]
    remote = remotefoo
    merge = refs/heads/newbranch
```

You can achieve the same configuration on an existing branch "newbranch" with:

```shell
git branch newbranch --set-upstream-to remotefoo/newbranch
```

However, if the goal is to push to another remote (e.g. remotefoo is not yours), then you
must do this manually:

```shell
git config branch.newbranch.pushRemote yourremote
```

When creating a new worktree, you might want to use `--track` if the target branch is a
remote branch, e.g.:

```shell
git worktree add --track remotefoo/existingbranch
```

As always, refer to the official documentation for proper usage explanation.

## Moving a Worktree

When moving a tree with checked out submodules, you will face this:

```txt
$ git worktree move foo/ bar/
fatal: working trees containing submodules cannot be moved or removed
```

It should be easier to simply:

```shell
mv foo bar
git -C bar worktree repair
git -C bar submodule update --init --recursive
```

[^1]: From [`man git-clone`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt-code--barecode): "Also the branch heads at the remote are copied directly to corresponding local branch heads, without mapping them to refs/remotes/origin/."
