Neovim is a Vim [fork] which aims to improve on its predecessor much like how Vim
improved Vi. It was started by a Brazilian developer, Thiago de Arruda, mostly to
improve Vim's [concurrency capabilities][idea]. It has been 10 years since and it has
gotten very popular so far. Meanwhile, one could argue that it also pushed Vim a little
into learning a few new tricks. RIP Bram, by the way, his legacy will be remembered for
generations to come. In this post I want to share a few tips on configuring Neovim for a
nice Linux Kernel development experience.

## Introduction

As many of you know, to configure and customize Vim you need to learn Vimscript. From my
experience, it isn't a friendly language. I'm sure I'm not alone in this take because
Neovim developers chose Lua for its embedded language. [Lua][lua] is a very straight
forward language, also originated in Brazil. It has some interesting users, such as
World of Warcraft user interface and Ginga, a Brazilian middleware for digital TV which
introduced me to Lua when I was in college. If you have a vimrc and is not sure of
making the leap to a Lua based configuration, you should try out [kickstart]. For a full
introduction, it's creator --- TJ DeVries, a core Neovim maintainer --- made a great
[video][tj] about it. Some other great tips are also shared by ThePrimeagen
[here][prime].

When I first got into Vim, in 2015, I was fascinated and my configuration files grew
larger and quicker than they should have. Everything was so new that most of the things
I wasn't even using and eventually I trimmed it all down into a minimalistic setup with
as few plugins as possible, so that I could focus on the important thing: learning Vim
the right way, i.e. leveraging as much of its core features as I could. A problem with
Neovim, in my opinion, is that its plugin ecosystem is so big and Lua makes it so easy
to configure things that the urge to install another one to cover that little corner of
a workflow is almost irresistible. That may trick some newcomers into acquiring some bad
habits, but that's all part of the game, I guess. What can I say, my [dotfiles] are as
big as they ever were.

## Treesitter & LSP

Specifically for Linux kernel development, though, there is this [great post][cscope].
It leverages cscope and ctags for source indexing, which is still very useful. However,
there are two things that Neovim supports which VSCode users will find familiar:
Treesitter and LSP. [Treesitter] enables more advanced syntax highlighting and [LSP],
the Language Server Protocol, is the Microsoft open standard that VSCode uses in the
back-end for things like auto completion and finding references.

Since late 2018, as far as I know, it is possible to build Linux using clang. If you do
it, there is a helper [script][ccscr] that will generate a compile_commands.json file
which can be used by [clangd] LSP [within Neovim][lspconfig]. What I usually do is to
run a allmodconfig build in Linus' tree and use its compile_commands.json in the root of
all the other worktrees I have around. That way I only have to index once, but it comes
with a few caveats:

- Since my host is x86_64, messing around with arch-specific files will show many
  missing symbol errors, since they weren't included in the build and therefore the
  compile_commands.json file.
- It is painfully slow to setup and index everything, but once it's done it's very
  useful.
- As you change files in a worktree, errors will inevitably appear since the index
  reference is pinned to Linus'.
- When jumping to references, if they're not within the same file, it takes me to Linus'
  tree and sometimes I'll edit that tree instead of the one I'm in. That can be
  distracting.

{{< figure src="/img/lsp_references.png" title="LSP references within Telescope." link="https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim">}}

If, however, you can't build with clang for some reason or you're doing too much
building that re-indexing all the time is simply not worth it, or perhaps LSP is just
not your cup of tea, then fear not: you can still use cscope with Neovim. Official
support for it [has been dropped][nocscope], but there's a [plugin][cscope-maps] that
does it. I even added a small Telescope [picker][telescope-cscope] for it. [Telescope]
is a powerful plugin that by itself is, in my humble opinion, capable of making even
Vim's most loyal users at least consider Neovim. It is a highly extendable fuzzy finder
that works with anything. You can pick buffers, help tags, man pages, LSP symbols,
quickfix items, registers, git files, you name it.

## Linters

A great script used by many, especially by newcomers like myself, is [checkpatch.pl].
Some maintainers dislike it, but anyone not used to the kernel coding style is highly
encouraged to use it. During my mentorship in the [Linux Foundation][mentorship], the
tip was to use it as a git post-commit hook:

```bash
exec git show --format=email HEAD | ./scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict --codespell
```

That is very useful, but what if you had it as a linter in your editor? This is very
straight forward to setup using [nvim-lint].

{{< figure src="/img/checkpatch.png" title="Viewing checkpatch.pl rules applied inline." link="https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim">}}

There is also [klint] for the rusty side of the kernel, but I still haven't found a way
of integrating it into Neovim.

## get_maintainer.nvim

In the past few weeks I have been working on a few cleanup patches suggested by Greg
Kroah-Hartman. The challenge was not so much the patch themselves, but submitting them
correctly into their respective trees. Initially I was going through each commit,
calling get_maintainer.pl by hand and checking in MAINTAINERS which tree (T:) I should
base them off of. Then I realized I would need to send a new patch to the same
maintainer again, whereas I could've squashed or assembled a series instead. Then I
finally discovered that get_maintainer.pl has a -\-scm option that also gives you the
relevant scm (source code management) trees.

So, with that, I decided to customize Neovim by writing a small [plugin][get_maintainer]
that would integrate nicely with the legendary [vim-fugitive]. I needed a wrapper that
would call get_maintainer.pl for the current file, ref or list of refs. That way I could
better organize which patches should be sent to whom and properly cherry-pick them on b4
branches for sending.

## Snippets

For the same task, instead of manually typing or pasting very similar commit messages
and risk introducing errors, I went ahead and defined a few snippets in Lua using
[LuaSnip]. Providing a snippet engine is a prerequisite for setting up LSP completions,
so I just chose the one where I could define them with Lua. It's very powerful once you
get the hang of it, so no more writing tags such as Cc:, Tested-by: and Suggested-by: or
frequently used email addresses by hand for me. Since you can define snippets based on
file types, you could even setup some things you always type like mail signatures, if
you use something like neomutt.

## Debugger

Many people argue that Vim is just a text editor and a full IDE is always to be
preferred and a key point to that is because using a debugger is easier. It's true that
learning Lua and spending more time configuring the editor is not for everyone, but it
can be quite satisfying and rewarding. In any case, there is also another Microsoft
creation apart from LSP that Neovim supports: the [Debug Adapter Protocol][dap]. For
integration, you need [nvim-dap] and I highly recommend the [nvim-dap-ui] as well so you
get a nice default user interface from the get go. Now, you only need an adapter and for
C/C++ that would be [cpptools]. To make your life easier you can use [Mason] to install
it and many others. Make sure to disable RANDOMIZE_BASE, then you would need something
like this:

```lua
local dap = require("dap") -- https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap
-- dap.set_log_level("TRACE")

dap.adapters.cppdbg = {
  id = "cppdbg",
  type = "executable",
  command = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/mason/bin/OpenDebugAD7", -- if you use mason
}

dap.configurations.c = {
	{
		name = "Attach to gdbserver :1234",
		type = "cppdbg",
		request = "launch",
		MIMode = "gdb",
		miDebuggerServerAddress = "localhost:1234",
		miDebuggerPath = "/usr/bin/gdb",
		cwd = "${workspaceFolder}",
		stopAtEntry = false,
		args = { "-ex", "continue" },
		program = "/mnt/md0/linux/ktest/build/sid/vmlinux",
		-- program = function()
		--   return vim.fn.input("Path to vmlinux: ", vim.fn.getcwd() .. "/", "file")
		-- end,
	},
}
```

It's certainly not perfect, especially for such a complex project. I've used it
extensively for Python debugging in the past and it's very good for that. I hope this
article made you curious about Neovim, or helped in any way if you're already a user.
Let me know if something should be in here that I've missed! Happy hacking.
