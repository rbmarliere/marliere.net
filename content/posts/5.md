## Introduction

**Ktest.pl** is a powerful script, [published in 2010][announce] by Steven Rostedt, long
time Linux contributor and Ftrace maintainer. Readily [available][ktest] upstream, along
with other useful scripts and tools, you can use it in different ways to automate the
process of building, installing and testing the Linux kernel.

## Motivation

Ever since I restarted doing cross builds more frequently, I would occasionally forget
to either set **ARCH=** or simply do a **modules_install**. Up until the point I
actually figured out the problem I already had lost precious time. By then, I had no
idea what the hell I was doing or what **.config** I was in. The solution came after
watching Steven's presentation ["A unique way to maintain a Linux kernel
subsystem"][rostedt] from last year's [Kernel Recipes][recipes] conference.

Also, one of the things that I have been doing in the last months is to build and test
[stable release candidates][stable-rc] and sometimes **-next** trees. Ktest provided me
a nice way of doing clean builds and keeping track of my default configuration across
different work trees. It became as simple as this:

```bash
cd $LINUX/next
ktest local
cd $LINUX/6.6.y
ktest local
reboot
```

Without having to worry about keeping different **.config** files in sync across
directories.

## Basic Setup[^1]

Let's start from the beginning, this is what I use as a wrapper in
**~/.local/bin/ktest**[^2]:

```bash

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "usage: ktest <config>"
    exit 1
fi

basepath=$HOME/ktest  # change this if you want it elsewhere
config=$(realpath "$basepath/$1.conf")

if [ ! -f "$config" ]; then
    echo "config file not found: $config"
    exit 1
fi

$basepath/ktest.pl $config
```

This way you can launch the script from any tree. Now, assuming you have a Linux git
repository in **$LINUX**:

```bash
# LINUX=/path/to/mainline
cp -r $LINUX/tools/testing/ktest $HOME
mkdir -p $HOME/ktest/{build,config}/local
mkdir $HOME/ktest/scripts
cp /boot/config-6.6.9-amd64 $HOME/ktest/config/local/stable
```

Note that **/boot/config-6.6.9-amd64** is just an example taken from [Debian][debpkg].
It is a huge configuration carefully tailored by the Debian Kernel Team to support most
of the hardware out there in the wild. You should probably [trim that down][trim] using
**make localmodconfig** for day to day usage.

This is an example of a standalone ktest configuration, put this in
**$HOME/ktest/local.conf** (or wherever you put the ktest directory):

```perl
MACHINE = local

THIS_DIR = /home/rbmarliere/ktest
BUILD_DIR = ${PWD}
CONFIG_DIR = ${THIS_DIR}/config/${MACHINE}
OUTPUT_DIR = ${THIS_DIR}/build/${MACHINE}
SCRIPTS_DIR = ${THIS_DIR}/scripts
CLEAR_LOG = 1
LOG_FILE = ${OUTPUT_DIR}/${MACHINE}.log

LOCALVERSION = -ktest

TEST_START
TEST_TYPE = build
BUILD_OPTIONS = -j$(nproc) bindeb-pkg
BUILD_NOCLEAN = 0
BUILD_TYPE = useconfig:${CONFIG_DIR}/stable
POST_BUILD = ${SCRIPTS_DIR}/local_install ${KERNEL_VERSION} ${OUTPUT_DIR}
```

As you can see, the **TEST_TYPE** is the most simple one: it just builds the kernel. The
**BUILD_TYPE** ensures that the **stable** configuration is used. The **POST_BUILD**
points to a script that actually installs the generated **.deb** packages and update the
boot loader. Add this to **~/.local/ktest/scripts/local_install**:

```bash

if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "usage: $0 <kernel version> <build output dir>"
    exit 1
fi

VERSION=$1
BUILD=$2

pushd "$BUILD/.." || exit 1

sudo dpkg -i ./linux-{image,headers}*"$VERSION"*.deb && sudo update-grub
rm -rf ./*"$VERSION"*{deb,changes,buildinfo}
rm -rf ./*{upstream,libc}*{deb,changes,buildinfo}

popd
```

## Cross-compilation Setup

If you remember from the [last post][last], I was experimenting with NFS and U-Boot.
That is, the board will boot from the kernel I have available locally on my development
host through tftp. Here is what I use as **rpi32.conf**:

```perl
MACHINE = rpi32
DTB = broadcom/bcm2837-rpi-3-b.dtb

INCLUDE include/defaults.conf

DEFAULTS OVERRIDE
MAKE_CMD = CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf- make ARCH=arm
BUILD_TARGET = arch/arm/boot/zImage
POST_BUILD = ${SCRIPTS_DIR}/tftp_install ${KERNEL_VERSION} ${OUTPUT_DIR} ${BUILD_TARGET} ${MACHINE} ${DTB}

TEST_START
TEST_TYPE = build
BUILD_TYPE = allnoconfig
BUILD_NOCLEAN = 0
```

As you can see, the **MAKE_CMD** is responsible of making sure that the build as always
made with the correct environment. Also, the build start point is an **allnoconfig**,
but that's because in my **include/defaults.conf** I have the following:

```perl
MIN_CONFIG = ${CONFIG_DIR}/config-min
```

In that file, I put the minimal configuration [from before][minimal], with some added
enabled symbols like **NFS_FS**, **SERIAL_AMBA_PL011_CONSOLE**, **BCM_VIDEOCORE**, etc.
That file is the bare minimum to be able to boot the machine, the basis from which ktest
will randomize the configuration if that is part of the test. But for this simple example,
it will only build and install the kernel. This time, using a different script, though:

```bash

TFTP=$HOME/ftp  # or wherever...

if [ $# -lt 4 ]; then
    echo "usage: $0 <kernel version> <build output dir> <build target> <machine> [dtb]"
    exit 1
fi

VERSION=$1
BUILD=$2
TARGET=$3
MACHINE=$4
DTB=$5

pushd $TFTP || exit 1

mkdir -p $MACHINE

pushd $MACHINE || exit 1

cp $BUILD/$TARGET linux-$VERSION
ln -sf linux-$VERSION linux

if [ -n "$DTB" ]; then
	cp $BUILD/$(dirname $TARGET)/dts/$DTB .
	ln -sf $(basename $DTB) dtb
fi

popd
popd
```

This will put the **dtb** and **zImage** in **$TFTP/$MACHINE/dtb** and
**$TFTP/$MACHINE/linux** as symlinks to the original files, which is where the U-Boot
script expect to find them.

## Virtual Machine Setup

This one is also straight forward and actually way better [documented][vm]. Just make
sure that you add the relevant entry to the boot loader with **console=ttyS0** so that
ktest is able to read it.

## Conclusion

I only scratched the surface here, but you can also test random kernel configurations,
bisect issues, run custom tests inside the machine, etc. So do go ahead and read the
[documentation][doc] for adapting it to your needs and make sure to review the
[examples][examples] too. You can also draw some inspiration from [this
repository][ftrace-ktests]. The goal of this post was to bring awareness to this
excellent tool, seeing that it improved my workflow a lot after adopting it.
