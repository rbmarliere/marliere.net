In this post, I will go through the steps for building and booting a [linux-next][next]
kernel on that board you have gathering dust somewhere.

{{< figure src="/img/rpi.png" >}}

**NOTE**: The contents of this post may be outdated by the time you read them.

Back in my [Funtoo][funtoo] [^1] days, I wrote a nasty [script][sysroot] to organize the
steps required to have a functioning cross-compilation toolchain in order to build the
[vendor][rpi-kernel] kernel. It had all sort of weird things that I wanted to learn,
such as embedding a dropbear ssh server in the initramfs and filesystem encryption. This
time, I wanted to try a different approach: what is the minimum possible setup I can
come up with to properly boot a root filesystem on the Pi?

If you followed along my [last post][better-workflow], you noticed that I chose to
configure a crash kernel to use with Kdump/Kexec from zero (**make allnoconfig**).
Though time consuming and a bit frustrating at times, its something that taught me
tremendously. The demanding trial and error process actually made me assimilate many key
kernel configuration symbols and how they work together, it was a great exercise.

This time, I knew that it wouldn't be as simple as it were for a x86_64 virtual machine
that emulates ancient hardware. With the Pi, I wanted to run an arm64 recent upstream
kernel with the minimal possible amount of firmware as well. Though there are many great
[resources][rpi-kdoc] [available][elinux-kernel], I was on my own. Here is what I came
up with.

## Debian Root Filesystem

First things first, we need a system to boot into. For that, I chose
[debootstrap][debootstrap] to create a full Debian system for the arm64 architecture.
This way you can chroot into the filesystem and act freely before properly burning an
image into an sd card. This is the process (all the variables in this post are
illustrative):

```shell
ROOTFS_PATH="$HOME/debian/arm64"
apt install debootstrap qemu-user-static binfmt-support qemu-system-arm
debootstrap --arch arm64 --components=main,contrib,non-free,non-free-firmware --foreign trixie $ROOTFS_PATH
chroot $ROOTFS_PATH bash -c "/debootstrap/debootstrap --second-stage"
```

- qemu-user-static is [needed][deb-qemu] to actually be able to chroot into the root
  directory and execute the arm64 programs therein from a foreign host (in my case,
  x86_64).
- "trixie" is the current [testing][deb-releases] distribution.
- Notice the **-\-foreign** argument to debootstrap. This is needed because you're
  building a root that is of an architecture that is different than your host's. Because
  of that, an extra step is [required][debootstrap-docs] (the second stage).

Now, add the **/etc/fstab** file while at it:

```shell
echo "/dev/mmcblk0p2 / ext4 defaults,noatime 0 1" > $ROOTFS_PATH/etc/fstab
```

## Kernel build

You could build your kernel from inside the aarch64 [^2] root, but that would have a hit
on performance and also increase the size of the root with all the required packages to
make it happen. We wanna keep things nice and clean. There are many [options][crosstool]
of toolchains out there that you can use for cross-compilation. This is the Debian way:

```shell
apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
```

If you haven't yet, this is the time you actually pull the Linux sources. If you're not
familiar with the [linux-next][next-docs] tree, that's where the kernel developers merge
their changes targeting the next [merge window][kdev]. Its goal is to be a reliable
preview of what the next version will look like, thus it conveniently anticipate many
common problems such as build errors and commit conflicts. Go ahead and setup your
sources, with something like this -- I can't recommend [git-worktrees][git-worktree]
highly enough:

```shell
# create your local work directory
LINUX_DIR="$HOME/linux"
mkdir $LINUX_DIR
cd $LINUX_DIR
# clone a bare repository
git clone --bare -o linus git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
cd linux.git
# add linux-next remote
git remote add next git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git
# update all remotes
git remote update
# add a worktree for the kernel you want to hack
git worktree add --checkout ../next-arm64 next-20231011
cd ../next-arm64
```

Now let's export some variables. When you [export][bash-docs] a variable, it is passed
down to the processes that you call, so `export ARCH=arm64; make` has the same effect as
of `ARCH=arm64 make`. This is useful if you're constantly running the same commands over
and over again and don't want a bloated sea of characters in your prompt.

```shell
# the target architecture
export ARCH=arm64
# fixed part of the binutils filenames from gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu package
export CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-
# where the kernel will be installed to
export INSTALL_PATH=$ROOTFS_PATH/boot
# where the modules will be installed to
export INSTALL_MOD_PATH=$ROOTFS_PATH
# where the device tree bindings of the Pi will be installed to
export INSTALL_DTBS_PATH=$ROOTFS_PATH/boot
```

All of these are properly documented [here][kbuild], apart from the usual "**make
help**". There's also some precious tips in the kernel [documentation][kconfig], I
wasn't aware of the scripts/diffconfig tool before, which is very useful for messing
around with configuration files. Also, inspecting old files with "**make
listnewconfig**" can be specially useful when analyzing vendor defaults.

Now comes the fun part, configuring the kernel:

```shell
make allnoconfig  # from `make help`: "allnoconfig - New config where all options are answered with no"
make menuconfig
```

For starters, you need to enable support for the [chip][rpi-wiki]:

ARCH_BCM
: Broadcom System-on-Chip systems

ARCH_BCM2835
: BCM2837 and BCM2711 SoCs (Raspberry Pi 3 and 4)

Then, you might wanna see some output on the screen -- through the HDMI port in my case:

DRM
: Direct Rendering Infrastructure, introduced in XFree86 4.0

DRM_V3D
: Broadcom V3D GPU

DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION
: Legacy fbdev emulation for DRM

FB
: Frame buffer device abstraction layer

FB_SIMPLE
: Support for a simple framebuffer

Later, we will burn an image into a sd card and use it for booting, so we need support
for it and also the EXT4 filesystem which will be used in the root partition:

MMC
: MMC/SD/SDIO I/O support

MMC_BCM2835
: MultiMediaCard controller driver for the BCM2835

EXT4_FS
: Extended Filesystem 4th generation

After successfully recognizing the disk and the root partition, the kernel will call the
**/sbin/init**, which in this case is a link to **/lib/systemd/systemd** [^3]. For that,
there are many requirements:

BINFMT_ELF
: Support for Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)

DEVTMPFS
: Early ramfs instance at bootup for /dev

TMPFS
: In-memory filesystem support

CGROUPS
: Process grouping isolation

INOTIFY_USER
: File monitoring interface for userspace

NET
: Networking support

UNIX
: Unix domain sockets

At this point you will land on a login prompt, but there will be no way of doing
anything because you haven't added support for input yet. Let's say you want to use a
simple USB keyboard, you first need to enable the features that permit the kernel to
power and communicate with devices:

MAILBOX
: On-chip processors communication framework

BCM2835_MBOX
: Mailbox for the BCM2835 SoC

RASPBERRYPI_FIRMWARE
: Support communication with the Raspberry Pi firmware

RASPBERRYPI_POWER
: Raspberry Pi power domain support

PM
: Device Power Management core functionality

Then you can actually add the USB and HID buses:

USB_SUPPORT
: Core Universal Serial Bus (USB) support

USB
: Enable host-side USB support

USB_DWC2
: Raspberry Pi 3 DWC2 USB Controller

HID_SUPPORT
: Human interface devices support

In my case, this is the driver I needed:

INPUT_KEYBOARD
: Enables keyboard drivers selection submenu

KEYBOARD_ATKBD
: Standard AT/PS2 keyboard

That's it, should be enough to have a working root. Build and install the kernel now,
making sure you have installed its [requirements][kdep]:

```shell
make -j$(nproc)
# make modules_install
make dtbs_install
make install  # ...or make bindeb-pkg, of course :)
```

## Boot Loader

To boot from a sd card, you need a vfat partition at the start of the disk containing
the firmware files. This is gonna be the **/boot**, which have the kernel and the
[device tree blobs][kdtb] already. You need three files from the vendor:

- [/boot/bootcode.bin][bootcode.bin]
- [/boot/start.elf][start.elf]
- [/boot/fixup.dat][fixup.dat]

So go ahead and download them into your arm64 root's **/boot** directory:

```shell
wget https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/raw/master/boot/bootcode.bin $ROOTFS_PATH/boot
wget https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/raw/master/boot/start.elf $ROOTFS_PATH/boot
wget https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/raw/master/boot/fixup.dat $ROOTFS_PATH/boot
```

Then, you need two configuration files:

- [**/boot/config.txt**][rpi-config]

```txt
arm_64bit=1
kernel=vmlinuz-6.6.0-rc5-next-20231011
device_tree=/broadcom/bcm2837-rpi-3-b.dtb
```

- **/boot/cmdline.txt**

```txt
root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait
```

## Image Creation

Now that you have a fully functional root filesystem, it's time to prepare it to go into
the sd card so that the Pi can finally boot it:

```bash
apt install dosfstools  # for mkfs.vfat

dd if=/dev/zero of=arm64.img bs=1M count=1024

losetup -fP arm64.img
losetup -a  # note which /dev/loopN is used, in my case N=0

cfdisk /dev/loop0
# DOS partition scheme:
#   1: 128M, type: b (W95 FAT32), bootable
#   2: ++, type: 83 (Linux)

mkfs.vfat /dev/loop0p1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/loop0p2

tmp=$(mktemp -d)
mount /dev/loop0p2 $tmp
mount /dev/loop0p1 $tmp/boot

cp -a $ROOTFS_PATH/. $tmp/.

umount $tmp/boot
umount $tmp

sync

losetup -d /dev/loop0

# replace <SD_CARD> with the correct value on your system
dd if=arm64.img of=/dev/<SD_CARD> status=progress
```

## What's next?

Well, there are many things to explore if you want to keep tinkering with the kernel
configuration symbols. For example, you could decide to add the **/dev/mmcblk0p1** boot
partition to your **/etc/fstab**, but that requires VFAT support:

VFAT_FS
: VFAT (Windows-95) fs support

NLS_CODEPAGE_437
: Default DOS codepage

NLS_ISO8859_1
: ISO/IEC 8859-1 character set

Maybe you want to figure out what's needed for complete networking support, or
learn more about [GPIO][elinux-gpio].

## Conclusion

Knowing exactly what you're enabling on the kernel and being able to actually boot it
can give you important insight about the different areas of knowledge that spans this
vast project. You'll be able to quickly find your way into whatever feature that you
might wanna learn about more. Although a nice exercise, you're probably better off with
the [vendor configuration][rpi-kconfig] as a starting point. There will be many things
there that you're probably not gonna use, but most of what you need will also be there.
Overall, this is one of the trade-offs distro kernel teams have to deal with.
