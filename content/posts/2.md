title: "A better workflow for kernel debugging"
date: 2023-10-08 15:15:00 -0300
---

If you followed along my last [post][simple-workflow], you may have found some
difficulties like I did. Namely, making sure the work is done without confusion. In this
post I want to share a few tips that helped me stay organized and effective, I hope its
helpful to some of you as well.

When I started investigating bugs I used to have a single **git** tree and then every
time I wanted to switch bugs or build a stable kernel it was **.config** hell, a
complete mess. I tried, then, maintaining different local repositories for different
trees. But this is a disk waste. Then I learned about the "**make O=**" trick to build
the objects somewhere else. It helped but I still had to checkout different commits and
keep a tab of what I was doing in my head. The solution was of course to use
[git-worktree][git-worktree]. This is the process (all the variables in this post are
illustrative):

```bash
# create your local work directory
LINUX_DIR="$HOME/linux"
mkdir $LINUX_DIR
cd $LINUX_DIR

# clone a bare repository
git clone --bare -o linus git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
cd linux.git

# add other relevant remotes to you
git remote add shuah git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shuah/linux-kselftest.git
git remote add staging git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git
git remote add stable git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
# (...)

# update all the remotes
git remote update
```

Now that you have a bare repository, you can add worktrees to split the different things
you might be doing into different directories. Here's an example:

```bash
cd $LINUX_DIR/linux.git

# add a worktree to track the stable/linux-6.5.y branch
git worktree add --track --branch linux-6.5.y ../stable stable/linux-6.5.y

# add a worktree for a syzkaller bug
git worktree add --checkout ../845cd8e5c47f2a125683 69b41ac87e4a
```

This way, you can have different directories with different kernel **.config** files and
different **git** histories and patches you might be working on. In the example above,
[845cd8e5c47f2a125683][845cd8e5c47f2a125683] is a random bug I selected and
[69b41ac87e4a][69b41ac87e4a] is the commit ref. from the **2023/01/04 06:51** row of its
crashes. You would proceed by downloading its **.config** and other relevant files such
as the reproducers. For that it's best to have a directory only for these:

```bash
BUGS_DIR="$HOME/syzkaller-bugs"
mkdir -p $BUGS_DIR/845cd8e5c47f2a125683
cd $BUGS_DIR/845cd8e5c47f2a125683

# download relevant files for the bug
# (you might wanna split those into timestamped directories,
#   e.g. $BUGS_DIR/845cd8e5c47f2a125683/202301040651 )
wget "https://syzkaller.appspot.com/text?tag=KernelConfig&x=9babfdc3dd4772d0" -O .config
wget "https://syzkaller.appspot.com/text?tag=ReproC&x=142a1eaa480000" -O rep.c
wget "https://storage.googleapis.com/syzbot-assets/d4a7091814ba/bzImage-69b41ac8.xz"
unxz bzImage-69b41ac8.xz

# make your life easier with a link to the worktree
ln -s $LINUX_DIR/845cd8e5c47f2a125683 linux

cp .config linux/
```

After the usual building process of the bzImage, its time to jump into a virtual machine
to test your changes. This can also be chaotic and inspired by this great [mentorship
session][tricks] done by Joel Fernandes, I wrote some [scripts][rq] to make my life
easier. The main tool is **rq**:

```txt
$ rq -h

usage: rq [-h] [-I IMG_DIR] [-k KERNEL] [--no-kernel] [-d DISK] [--no-disk]
          [-i INITRD] [-b BIOS] [-p PORT] [-f [F ...]] [-F [F ...]] [-c]
          [-a APPEND] [-g] [--wait-gdb] [--no-snapshot] [--debug]

Run qemu with sane defaults

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -I IMG_DIR, --img-dir IMG_DIR
                        directory containing images (e.g. initramfs, disk,
                        bios), can be set through RQ_IMGDIR environment variable
                        (default: /home/rbmarliere/images)
  -k KERNEL, --kernel KERNEL
                        kernel bootable image to use with -kernel (default:
                        linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage)
  --no-kernel           do not use -kernel (default: False)
  -d DISK, --disk DISK  disk image to use with -drive (default:
                        /home/rbmarliere/images/disk.img)
  --no-disk             do not use -drive (default: False)
  -i INITRD, --initrd INITRD
                        initrd image to use with -initrd (default: None)
  -b BIOS, --bios BIOS  bios image to use with -bios (default:
                        /home/rbmarliere/images/seabios.bin)
  -p PORT, --port PORT  host's port to forward into guest's ssh port using -net
                        (default: 10022)
  -f [F ...]            file(s) to copy into the disk (default: None)
  -F [F ...]            file(s) to copy into the cpio initrd (default: None)
  -c, --crash           append crashkernel= to cmdline (default: False)
  -a APPEND, --append APPEND
                        append kernel parameters (default: None)
  -g, --gdb             use -s (default: False)
  --wait-gdb            use -S if -s is used (default: False)
  --no-snapshot         do not use -snapshot (default: False)
  --debug               print qemu command instead of running it (default:
                        False)
```

This makes me able to do many things without having to worry about searching back my
shell history for the right **qemu** command. It's not perfect, but it helps. If you
noticed, the **--bios** parameter defaults to **/home/rbmarliere/images/seabios.bin**,
this is because I'm using a custom built image with a [patch][seabios_patch] to
[SeaBIOS][seabios] that gets rid of the code that truncates long lines in the terminal,
so that I don't lose precious info from logs. This is what it calls on a default run
without parameters, inside a directory such as **$BUGS_DIR/845cd8e5c47f2a125683**:

```txt
$ rq --debug

qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -m 8G \
    -smp 2,sockets=2,cores=1 \
    -net nic,model=e1000 \
    -net user,host=10.0.2.25,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22 \
    -enable-kvm \
    -nographic \
    -bios /home/rbmarliere/images/seabios.bin \
    -snapshot \
    -kernel linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage \
    -drive format=raw,file=/home/rbmarliere/images/disk.img
```

If you're feeling courageous and want to give it a try, install them with something like
this:

```bash
GIT_DIR="$HOME/git"

git clone git@github.com:rbmarliere/rq.git $GIT_DIR/rq

cd $HOME/.local/bin
for file in $GIT_DIR/rq/*; do ln -s $file; done

# add ~/.local/bin to your $PATH, if you don't have it
echo export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Some examples:

```bash
export RQ_IMGDIR=~/images

# run a specific kernel after copying a reproducer into the disk
rq -k bzImage-69b41ac8 -f rep.c

# use an initramfs instead of a disk as the root filesystem
rq -i initramfs.cpio.gz -F rep.c --no-disk -a "root=/dev/ram"

# make permanent changes to the disk root filesystem
rq --no-snapshot

# debug the VM with gdb
rq -g --wait-gdb

```

## Kdump

Recently I was looking into a bug that is a concurrency problem. That means that,
although the reproducer provided can in fact reproduce the problem, it happens at random
times. That means you are probably gonna have to wait for a long time. So as much as the
**gdb** workflow presented in the [last post][simple-workflow] is very useful, for bugs
like this it can be quite painful. Using [Kdump][kdump-doc] and the [crash
utility][crash] enabled me to inspect the system state at any time without having to
depend on a running virtual machine.

I went through this [excellent presentation][postmortem] by Steven Rostedt and I must
say, it took me a while to grasp the process and setup everything. But its a very good
tool to have, sometimes. Hopefully I can help you save some time. The first thing you
need is to build a "crash" kernel. This is the kernel that it's going to replace the
system kernel after a panic. Here is what I did:

```bash
cd $LINUX_DIR/linux.git

git worktree add --checkout ../crash v6.5.6
cd ../crash

make allnoconfig
# from `make help`:
# allnoconfig     - New config where all options are answered with no

make menuconfig
# TIP: when you search for a string using '/' character, the list provided
# have numbers attached to them, which you can use to quickly jump to its
# entry in the menu; you can also use '?' character for help.
```

Search and enable the following:

64BIT
: 64-bit kernel

PCI
: support for PCI bus

ATA
: support for ATA hard disk used in -disk parameter

ATA_PIIX
: ATA controller emulated by the default qemu x86_64 machine

SERIAL_8250
: support for serial ports

SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE
: this enables the virtual machine console to be readable


EXT4_FS
: the filesystem used before, when creating the root fs

BLK_DEV_SD
: this makes /dev/sda visible


NET
: we want networking inside the VM

NETDEVICES
: add support for networking devices

E1000
: driver for the -net nic,model=e1000 parameter


INET
: TCP/IP support

UNIX
: Unix sockets support, e.g. for /var/log/* and system utils

PACKET
: Packet protocol


BINFMT_ELF
: enables kernel to execute ELF files

BINFMT_SCRIPT
: enables kernel to execute '#!' scripts

DEVTMPFS
: create a /dev early on, to support early API filesystems

DEVTMPFS_MOUNT
: auto mount /dev

TMPFS
: support early API filesystems

CRASH_DUMP
: Kdump requirement

RELOCATABLE
: Kdump requirement


CGROUPS
: \* (systemd requirement)

INOTIFY_USER
: \* (systemd requirement)

DEBUG_FS
: \*

SECURITYFS
: \*

CONFIGFS_FS
: \*

BINFMT_MISC
: \*

AUTOFS_FS
: \* (for proc-sys-fs-binfmt_misc.automount service)


Then, build the compressed kernel image:

```bash
make bzImage
```

This was the first time I configured a minimal kernel from zero and I learned a lot from
it. These are the symbols that need to be enabled to successfully boot the kernel after
a crash. Note that the ones marked with **\*** are dependencies for the root filesystem.
Systemd needs CGROUPS and INOTIFY_USER and the others come from the **/etc/fstab**
written by the syzkaller's [create-image.sh][syzkaller-fstab] script that I used to
create my root filesystem (therefore, optional).

After this, you should install **kdump-tools** inside your VM:

```bash
# you can use any kernel to boot the VM, e.g.
cd $BUGS_DIR/845cd8e5c47f2a125683
rq --no-snapshot -k bzImage-69b41ac8

# after booting, inside the VM
apt install kdump-tools
vi /etc/default/kdump-tools
```

Edit the **/etc/default/kdump-tools** file, inside the VM, accordingly (remember to use
**-\-no-snapshot** to make it permanent). Please refer to Debian's documentation on
kdump-tools in [/usr/share/doc/kdump-tools/README.Debian][kdump-deb-doc]. Here is mine:

```bash
USE_KDUMP=1
KDUMP_COREDIR="/var/crash"
SSH="rbmarliere@10.0.2.25"
SSH_KEY="/root/.ssh/id_rsa"
```

This way, whenever a crash happens, the **kdump-tools** will transfer the dump file into
my host's **/var/crash/** directory. Before, I did the usual **ssh** authorization
process of creating a **ssh** key with [**ssh-keygen**][ssh-keygen] in the host,
transferring the private id_rsa into the VM and pasting the public key into the host's
**~/.ssh/authorized_keys**. Also, make sure **/var/crash** is owned and writable by your
user in the host, or change **KDUMP_COREDIR** to something else.

Now we are only missing three things:

- Boot the system kernel with **crashkernel=** cmdline;
- Load the crash kernel into memory using **kexec**;
- Trigger the crash;

```bash
# make your life easier with a link to the crashkernel
cd $BUGS_DIR/
ln -s $LINUX_DIR/crash/arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage crashkernel

# copy the crashkernel into the root filesystem next time you boot a VM
# -f copies the file into /root/ by default
# -c will append crashkernel=256M to the boot cmdline
cd $BUGS_DIR/845cd8e5c47f2a125683
rq -c -f ../crashkernel

# after boot, inside the VM
kexec -p /root/crashkernel --append="console=ttyS0 root=/dev/sda"

# trigger the crash with CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y
echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger

# ...or run a syz reproducer
gcc rep.c && ./a.out
```

Note the need for **root=/dev/sda** for the automatic handling of the crash dump taking
place. If all went well, you're gonna see the dump and the dmesg files under your host
**/var/crash** directory. But how to use it? Here enters the [crash utility][crash]. For
some reason that I didn't fully understand -- probably Debian related[^1] -- I was only
able to inspect the dump file using a locally built binary. Therefore, don't install the
[crash][crash-deb] package in your host.

```bash
$GIT_DIR/crash/crash $LINUX_DIR/845cd8e5c47f2a125683/vmlinux dump.202310081631

Note that you should have DEBUG_INFO enabled on the system kernel that crashed!

## General tips

I use this as my **/root/.bash_profile** inside the VM:

```bash
# fix the row/col height of the terminal
stty rows 71 cols 113

# auto build whatever rep.c copied into /root/ using `rq -f`
[ -f ~/rep.c ] && gcc ~/rep.c

# make your life easier with some aliases
alias a="./a.out"
alias s="./syz-execprog syz"
alias kex="kexec -p crashkernel --append='console=ttyS0 root=/dev/sda'"
```

Also this **~/.ssh/config** in my host system to quickly **ssh** or **scp** into the VM:

```txt
Host syz
	Hostname localhost
	User root
	NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes
	IdentityFile ~/images/syzkaller.id_rsa
	Port 10022
```

In my host **~/.bashrc**, I use these:

```bash
LINUX_DIR=~/linux

# function to get maintainer for a patch from anywhere
get_maintainer() {
	if [ -z "$1" ]; then
		echo "usage: get_maintainer <patch> <opts>"
		return
	fi
	patch=$(realpath $1)
	shift 1
	if [[ -f scripts/get_maintainer.pl ]]; then
		scripts/get_maintainer.pl "$patch" $*
	else
		pushd $LINUX_DIR/linus > /dev/null  # assumes a 'linus' worktree there
		scripts/get_maintainer.pl "$patch" $*
		popd > /dev/null
	fi
}

# enables the use of `cd bugs` from anywhere
shopt -s cdable_vars
bugs=~/syzkaller-bugs

# a few useful aliases
alias cdL="cd $LINUX_DIR/linux/linux.git"
alias cdl="cd $LINUX_DIR/linux"
alias checkpatch="$LINUX_DIR/linus/scripts/checkpatch.pl"
alias db="gdb -tui -ex 'target remote :1234' -d linux"
alias make='make -j$(nproc)'
```

I hope I provided some inspiration to improve your workflow if you are a kernel hacker
wannabe like myself. If you have any question, comment, critic, suggestion or if you
spotted an error in here, please don't hesitate in reaching out to me at
[ricardo@marliere.net][email].

[^1]: As far as I can tell, **kdump-tools** is packaged with the clear use case of
    dumping a running Debian kernel and depends on the distro **/boot/\*** files
